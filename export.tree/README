The APPLESEED Example Dataset

This dataset consists of longitudinal EEG recordings from 13 infants at 4, 8, and 12 months of age. Test-retest reliability was assessed at 4 months of age via two appointments (session 1 & 2) that occurred within 1 week of each other. Session 3 data was recorded at 8 months of age and session 4 data was recorded at 12 months of age. Two participants did not return for longitudinal testing at sessions 3 & 4. Therefore, the complete dataset consists of 48 recording sessions, with reliability and longitudinal data (sessions 1-4) for 11 infants (6 F), and reliability data only (sessions 1 & 2) for an additional 2 infants.

This dataset was used to develop and validate the Automated Preprocessing Pipe-Line for the Estimation of Scale-wise Entropy from EEG Data (APPLESEED) and is provided as an example dataset to accompany Puglia, M.H., Slobin, J.S., & Williams, C.L., 2021.
